This repository contain simulations of Markov chains: gambler's ruin, one-, two- and three-dimensional random walk, random walk in a circle, the Ehrenfest model, the two-state process, traversing a maze (average number of returns and stationary distribution), and branching processes (mean population and extinction probability).
